# ToonTanks

This is my first project in UE4, created with the purpose of learning and experimenting.

It is entirely done in C++ except for the blueprint widgets used for the main menu and the UI.

Game includes:
* main menu with level selector
* very simple AI
* different enemy types
* simple weapons and ammo system
* abilities system (speed bost and shield)
* power-ups
